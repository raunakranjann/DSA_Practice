// Question 5 : For a positive N , WAP that prints the first N Fibonacci numbers.
// (Assume N >= 2)
// Fibonacci series : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 â€¦.
// This is a series where each number is a sum of previous 2 numbers in the series. Eg :
// 1 = 0 + 1,
// 2 = 1 + 1,
// 3 = 1 + 2,
// 5 = 2 + 3,
// 8 = 3 + 5 & so on.
